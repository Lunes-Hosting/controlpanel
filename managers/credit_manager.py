Credit Management Module
=================

This module handles all credit-related operations including:
- Credit addition and removal
- Automated credit usage calculation
- Server suspension based on credit status
- Credit-based server unsuspension

Functions in this module interact with both the local database and the Pterodactyl API
to manage the credit system across the platform.
